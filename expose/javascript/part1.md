question 1: values added: 20
question 2: final result: 20

question 3: line 9 would print values added: 20  but because of line 13 the code returns an error
question 4: the code returns an error because this line is referring to the 
variable result outside of the if code block, so it wont be a defined variable since
let varaibles can only be accessed within the block it is defined in

question 5: line 9 would print values added: 0  but because of line 7 the code gives an error
because you cannot reassign a constant variable 
question 6: line 13 would also cause an error because you cannot refer a const variable outside of the code block it was defined in
